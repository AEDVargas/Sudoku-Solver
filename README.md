# Sudoku Solver
I developed a Sudoku solver that iterates through a system of context index structures to solve cells containing 1 single candidate until completion.

To solve a game a simple text file needs to be created and entered with values of "0" to represent incompleted cells.

A series of performance indicators are recorded while solving the puzzle to display the efficiency of the code.
